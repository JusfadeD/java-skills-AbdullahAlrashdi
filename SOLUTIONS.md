Task 2: Basic Java Programming



What I Learned:

\- How to create Java classes with proper encapsulation using private fields, getters, and setters.

\- How to build constructors to initialize objects easily.

\- How to apply switch-case logic and nested if-else structures to handle business logic (like pay and tax).

\- How to format outputs using both `System.out.println()` and `System.out.printf()` (and why one is cleaner, but the other is simpler).

Challenges I Faced:

\- Remembering when to use static vs. non-static methods.

\- Making sure all cases were handled, like negative input or invalid employee types.

\- Formatting payroll output in a way that looks good but is still readable and simple.



&nbsp;How I Tested My Code:

\- I created sample data for multiple employee types and printed both individual and batch results.

\- I ran `javac` and `java` from the command line to make sure everything compiles and runs independently.

\- I modified test values and verified calculations by hand (e.g. checking gross vs. net after tax).



One Thing I’d Like to Improve:

\- I want to get faster at spotting logic that can be simplified or refactored.

\- I also want to learn how to use unit testing frameworks like JUnit in the future to automate test cases instead of manually printing everything.

Task 3: Strings and Arrays



What I Learned:

\- How to reverse strings using `StringBuilder` and loop through arrays.

\- How to handle simple conditions for grading and identifying failing students.

\- How to split strings and replace words in a sentence using basic Java string methods.



Challenges I Faced:

\- Honestly, not much. These were basic problems and I already understood the logic.

\- I just had to remind myself to handle empty strings or null inputs properly.



How I Tested My Code:

\- I used sample arrays like `{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}` and printed outputs directly using `System.out.println()`.

\- Changed values multiple times to test fail conditions and replacement accuracy.

\- Didn’t use any formatting — kept it raw and simple to focus on correctness.



One Thing I’d Like to Improve:

\- I want to get better at writing cleaner code while keeping it readable — even when it’s simple.

\- Maybe learn how to write basic unit tests to avoid manually printing everything.

✅ Task 4: OOP

hat I learned:
- How to extend one class from another.
- How `protected` lets the child class see stuff.
- How to override a method and still call the parent one with `super`.
- The difference between static and non-static variables.

What was annoying:
- Remembering `super()` and making sure constructors lined up.
- Forgetting to override `displayInfo()` at first.

How I tested it:
- Made some books and a textbook.
- Borrowed them, returned them, printed stuff.
- Tried the visitor counter with a few names to see if the static count works.

What I’d fix:
- I’d write cleaner classes if the system was bigger.
- Also maybe learn abstract classes or interfaces later.
