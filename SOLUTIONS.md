Task 2: Basic Java Programming



What I Learned:

\- How to create Java classes with proper encapsulation using private fields, getters, and setters.

\- How to build constructors to initialize objects easily.

\- How to apply switch-case logic and nested if-else structures to handle business logic (like pay and tax).

\- How to format outputs using both `System.out.println()` and `System.out.printf()` (and why one is cleaner, but the other is simpler).

Challenges I Faced:

\- Remembering when to use static vs. non-static methods.

\- Making sure all cases were handled, like negative input or invalid employee types.

\- Formatting payroll output in a way that looks good but is still readable and simple.



&nbsp;How I Tested My Code:

\- I created sample data for multiple employee types and printed both individual and batch results.

\- I ran `javac` and `java` from the command line to make sure everything compiles and runs independently.

\- I modified test values and verified calculations by hand (e.g. checking gross vs. net after tax).



One Thing Iâ€™d Like to Improve:

\- I want to get faster at spotting logic that can be simplified or refactored.

\- I also want to learn how to use unit testing frameworks like JUnit in the future to automate test cases instead of manually printing everything.
